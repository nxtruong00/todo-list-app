# Angular Todo List Application

This is a simple Todo List application built with Angular. It allows users to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and remove tasks.

## Features

- Add tasks: Users can enter new tasks and add them to the list.
- Mark tasks as completed: Users can mark tasks as completed by checking the checkbox next to each task.
- Remove tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking the delete button next to each task.

## Installation
npm i angular-todo-list-app

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
